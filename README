This repository contains a minimal LaTeX setup that uses Make to build a PDF
file. You can find many like it on the Internet, but this one is mine.

Adjust TITLE variable on top of Makefile to fit the title of the document and
name of the .tex file.

To build the document:

    $ make

To clean-up the directory:

    $ make clean
